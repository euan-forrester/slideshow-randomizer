# slideshow-randomizer

Helps you make a randomized slideshow in Final Cut Pro by copying a directory full of images into another directory with the same files but with random numbers as filenames. Simply drag them into Final Cut Pro and it'll read them in alphabetical order.

Usage: `./randomize.py <input dir> <output dir>`

![10 Years of Soundproof slideshow](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4471/23677360798_287e69703e_c_d.jpg)

In September 2017 I used this to create a slideshow as part of a photography installation documenting 10 years of an electronic music collective named Soundproof. You can find the final slideshow here: http://euanforresterphotography.com/soundproof-installation

I chose to order the photos randomly because I think it keeps the slideshow engaging â€” you never know what's coming next. And the randomness also found interesting pairings between the photos that I never would have seen otherwise. Most importantly, I think that the randomness reflects my view of Soundproof as a timeless constant with no beginning and no end. A photo from 2007 can be beside one from 2017 and it's hard to tell which one came first.
