# slideshow-randomizer

Helps you make a randomized slideshow in Final Cut Pro by copying a directory full of images into another directory with the same files but with random numbers as filenames. Simply drag them into Final Cut Pro and it'll read them in alphabetical order.

Usage: `./randomize.py <input dir> <output dir>`

In September 2017 I used this to create a slideshow as part of a photography installation documenting 10 years of an electronic music collective named Soundproof. You can find the final slideshow here: http://euanforresterphotography.com/soundproof-installation
